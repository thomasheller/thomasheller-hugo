## Yoga and IT

I find that yoga and meditation help me focus my thoughts, be more
creative and productive. The physical exercises compensate for poor
posture that results from many hours of desk work.

  - From June 2015 to June 2016, I worked at [Yoga Vidya](http://www.yoga-vidya.de) &#8211; Europe&#8217;s biggest yoga seminar house &#8211; where I provide IT services as well as guiding meditations and being an assistant teacher in yoga classes and teacher training courses. I practice the [Five Tibetan Rites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites) daily.
  - In October 2014, I took several months off from regular work to study yoga source texts like the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> and the <em>Upanishads</em> in-depth and to complete an intensive yoga teacher training course.
  - As part of my New Year&#8217;s resolution for 2014 to live a healthier life, I started practicing yoga and meditation on a regular basis.

## Spiritual Experience

  - In May 2014, I began a [simple living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living) project. I greatly reduced my possessions to spend more quality time doing things that really matter. Along the way, I co-founded [minimalisten.org](http://minimalisten.org/), a German-speaking community for simple living enthusiasts.
  - Since December 2013, I&#8217;ve been following a vegetarian diet for both health and ethical reasons.
  - During my apprenticeship in Freiburg, I took a Tai Chi and Qi Gong beginners&#8217; class to learn more about the relationship between body, mind and energy.
  - From 2010 to 2012 I did voluntary work at [Cru](http://cru.org) where I helped organizing Christian services for college students.
  - Wanting to deepen my knowledge of western and eastern religious traditions as well as contemporary movements I took courses in Religious Studies and Protestant Theology at the University of Heidelberg.
  - During my A levels, I practiced [Aikido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido) and meditation for almost a year. I studied the philosophical works of Aikido&#8217;s founder, Ueshiba Morihei, a pacifist and spiritual master.
  - In 2004, I got acquainted with Traditional Chinese Medicine and Feng Shui, developing a more holistic view of the world.
  - From 2004 to 2006 I was involved in organizing meet-ups for highly gifted young adults and adults throughout Germany where I got connected to a wide variety of people, interests and world-views.
  - Although being baptized as a baby in Protestant tradition, I grew up in a largely secular household. I would approve of humanist ideals as put forth by [Gene Roddenberry](https://humanism.org.uk/humanism/the-humanist-tradition/20th-century-humanism/gene-roddenberry/) and [Eric S. Raymond&#8217;s](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) writings on hacker culture.
